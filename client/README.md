# ------------------------ Docker Commands ------------------------

# If you have already built the Docker image locally, ensure that you've tagged it correctly and that it exists in your local Docker image repository. You can verify this by running:
# -> docker images


# If you see your my-nextjs-app image listed, make sure you're using the correct image name and tag when running the container. For example:
# -> docker run -d -p 3000:3000 wbl-client-app:latest
